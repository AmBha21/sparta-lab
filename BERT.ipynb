doctor's\\nappointment\\nthis video is about what that was like\\nwhy big institutions fall apart and why\\nthey're so difficult to change\\nas research I've spoken to some of the\\nnhs's most senior administrators so over\\nthe course of this rational analysis\\nI'll be revealing some exclusive Insider\\ninformation\\nthe video is sponsored by nebula but\\nafter I've paid back the owner of this\\nlaptop I'll be donating most of that\\nmoney to charity so you can sit back and\\nrelax as I bring you a calm\\ndispassionate exploration of the big\\nquestions at the heart of Britain's\\nNational Health Service\\n[Music]\\nwelcome back\\n[Music]\\n[Music]\\nhere's how things are supposed to work\\nBritish citizens of all ages have a\\nright to free health care on the\\nNational Health Service or NHS I was\\nborn in the NHS and both my parents were\\ndoctors my dad used to say when I was a\\nkid that he treated everyone from all\\nwalks of life from literal Aristocrats\\nto prisoners from the local jail because\\nthe point of the service is that it's\\nthere for everyone since its Creation in\\n1948 the NHS has become the symbol of\\nthe country that a lot of British people\\nare very proud of like the royal family\\nor William Shakespeare or beans on toast\\nthe NHS is split into several Regional\\nbodies called trusts like there's a\\nCambridge trust and an Oxford trust and\\nan East London trust and a West London\\ntrust and so on the trusts get money\\nfrom the government which they spend on\\nHealth Care Services like Staffing\\nequipment and supplies and they give\\nthat to patients for free in this way\\nthe NHS is funded mainly by the taxpayer\\nbut even if you don't make enough money\\nto pay taxes you can still use it\\nbecause again the point of the service\\nis that it's there forever everyone\\nwhich it definitely definitely is as\\nwell as the right to use the NHS we also\\nhave the right to begin treatment within\\n18 weeks of referral and that right to\\nfree medical treatment within 18 weeks\\nincludes free medical transition for\\ntransgender people of all ages if you\\ndidn't already know\\nthat includes me I'm a trans woman and\\nwe'll be using the nhs's treatment of me\\nas our case study for today which will\\nreveal some more General things about\\nhow the service is run and the\\nchallenges that it's facing in the 21st\\ncentury\\nif you want to medically transition in\\nEngland then you can start by going to\\nyour local family doctor in Britain we\\ncall this person a general practitioner\\nor GP your GPA will send you to a gender\\nidentity Clinic where you'll be assessed\\nby Specialists to see if you fit the\\ncriteria for gender dysphoria a\\ndiagnosis that is definitely real and\\nwhich definitely makes a lot of sense if\\nyou are diagnosed with dysphoria then\\nthey'll let you use other bits of the\\nNHS for example if you want surgery\\nthey'll send you to a surgeon if you\\nwant hormones they'll tell your GP to\\nprescribe hormones for you which your GP\\ndefinitely will\\nonce you're in the medical system you\\ncan also change the legal sex that is\\nrecorded on your birth certificate and\\nyour passport in England you cannot\\nchange either of those things without\\nfirst obtaining a doctor's permission\\nbut it all starts with a friendly visit\\nto your local NHS doc who will be only\\ntoo happy to provide you with\\nworld-class Medical Care from the finest\\nsystem\\nin the world\\nseveral years ago I went to my GP told\\nher I'm trans and asked to be referred\\nto a gender identity Clinic the first\\nthing she did was refuse\\nnot exactly after a great start\\nI won't name her or any of the real\\npeople I'll be referring to today\\ninstead I'll call her\\nlieutenant scheisskoff\\n[Music]\\nscheisskopf told me to come back in a\\nmonth and said that if I was still trans\\nthen\\nshe would refer me\\nGPS in England aren't routinely trained\\nin trans medicine hence the separate\\nclinics so the idea that you're supposed\\nto wait a month before you can go\\nshe made that up on the spot\\nshe also tried to send me to Mental\\nHealth Services which wasn't what I was\\nthere for she only had one job send me\\nto the gender Clinic\\nbut for some reason she wouldn't do it I\\nam not the only patient who fell at the\\nfirst hurdle\\nthis is a 2013 NHS report titled\\nmonitoring and promoting trans Health\\nacross the Northwest the authors\\ninvestigated the needs of trans patients\\nacross Northwest England and how GPS\\nwere meeting those needs or rather they\\ntried to but they couldn't\\nbecause GPS overwhelmingly refused to\\ncooperate with the researchers only half\\nof the practices they investigated even\\nreplied\\nand that was just the beginning it was\\nextremely difficult to get Beyond\\nreception staff to speak to practice\\nmanagers\\nfor example the research was told many\\ntimes that the practice manager was not\\nin but would be later only to be told\\nlater that they were on leave or did not\\nwork in the afternoons\\nvery few practice managers understood\\nwhat was meant by transgender people and\\nwere unwilling to engage in this\\nresearch\\nsome practice managers receptionists and\\nGPS were spoken to express particularly\\nnegative attitudes towards trans people\\nthis study clearly demonstrates that\\nmost GP practices are not sufficiently\\nprepared or knowledgeable to\\nappropriately address the needs of this\\npatient group 2013 was almost a decade\\nago but more recent data and my own\\nexperience confirms this is still a\\nproblem this 2015 NHS report which\\nsolicited feedback from patients and\\nstaff also highlighted uncooperative GPS\\nas a major problem this 2016 article in\\nthe British medical journal says the\\nsame thing\\nin 2021 the non-profit Trans actual ran\\na survey which included questions about\\nHealthcare 14 of trans respondents said\\nthat their GPS like mine simply refused\\nto help them that's more than one in ten\\nas my friend Alice is fond of saying the\\nNHS is a wonderful Institution\\nunfortunately it is run by the British\\nbut I didn't have any other choice so\\nI went away for a month as ordered and\\n30 days later surprise surprise I was\\nstill transgender so I went back to\\nLieutenant scheisskoff a second time and\\nthis time she said she would refer me\\nsix months went by\\nI remind you that we have the right to\\nbe treated within 18 weeks so at this\\npoint I've already waited double that\\nand I'm not even in the door\\nbut after six months I still hadn't even\\ngotten so much as a letter from the\\nclinic saying I was in the system so I\\nwent back to scheisskopf a third time\\nand this time she said oh\\nthe letters still here\\nI must have forgotten to send it\\ndismissed captain\\nI said dismiss Captain get the hell out\\nof my office the last time I took from\\nthis was that my doctor was either so\\nincompetent she couldn't work a post box\\nor more likely she didn't want to give\\nme Medical Care\\nneither of which is great to be honest\\nhonestly you think you're on good terms\\nwith someone and then you come out as\\ntrans and suddenly they don't want\\nanything to do with you anymore\\nin a lot of ways the NHS is just like my\\ndad I just like to clarify that that was\\na joke I have a normal and happy\\nrelationship with my father who is a\\nvery supportive and loving man at this\\npoint I moved to a different area of the\\ncountry and signed up with a new GP\\nand I went along and I asked to be sent\\nto the gender clinic but this time\\nI printed out the NHS rules on treating\\ntrans patients and highlighted the\\nrelevant sections so when he said I'm\\nsorry I can't send you to the clinic I\\npulled them out and I said actually\\ndoctor you not only can\\nyou are required to\\nafter a great deal of persuasion he did\\nin fact agree to follow the rules\\nand he referred me to the clinic I made\\nsure to get a signed and dated copy of\\nthat referral\\nUnder the Clock officially\\nstarted I waited 18 weeks\\nI waited 18 more weeks\\nand then I waited\\n18\\nmore\\nthere are currently seven gender clinics\\nfor adults operating in England none of\\nthem are seeing patients within the\\nrequired 18-week limit and waiting lists\\nare extremely long\\nhow long you ask well at a time of\\nrecording the largest clinic in London\\nhas 11 407 patients on its waiting list\\nlast month they offered first\\nappointments\\n250.\", \"that means that if you were referred\\ntoday\\nyou will be waiting for 19 years\\nand that's not 19 years for health care\\neither that's 19 years for a first\\nappointment of which you may have\\nseveral with months or even years\\nbetween them you might be wondering wow\\nonly 50 maybe they had a really slow\\nmonth last month maybe that's throwing\\nthe numbers off nope\\n50 is pretty typical\\nthat's actually better than it used to\\nbe when I was referred it was 26 years\\nthe long waiting times contribute to\\nhigh levels of\\ndistress\\namong trans patients it also impacts our\\naccess to civil rights like marriage\\ndeath and privacy because remember in\\nEngland if you want to change the sex\\nmarker on your birth certificate or\\npassport you need a doctor's permission\\nif you haven't changed the marker on\\nyour passport for instance because\\nyou're on a year's Long waiting list to\\nget permission then every time you apply\\nto rent a flat or get a job you'll have\\nto show them your passport and they'll\\ninstantly know your trans\\nemployers and landlords are not allowed\\nto discriminate\\nha ha ha ha ha ha long waiting times are\\nan especially acute problem when it\\ncomes to trans children\\nif you know that you're trans at a young\\nage and you're forced to go through the\\nwrong puberty it can be very distressing\\nand it can cause dare I say it\\nirreversible damage or not really damage\\nbut it has permanent effects for\\ninstance I went through a testosterone\\npuberty as an adolescent and as a result\\nI'm taller than the average English\\nwoman\\nalso I can do this with my voice\\nwhenever I want to\\n[Music]\\nI mean I think those things are\\npositives about me because I really like\\nbeing tall and also it's useful as an\\nactress to have two voices and a perfect\\nimpersonation of Matt Berry on tap and\\nthere are other effects that are\\nnegative and also permanent so it's\\nespecially important that trans children\\nget prompt treatment if you're 13 and\\ntrans and there's a years-long wait to\\nget care\\nthen by the time you're seen it could be\\ntoo late\\nand your life is not over if that\\nhappens to you\\nbut it will shape the rest of your time\\non Earth\\nand that's what a lot of this comes down\\nto\\nwaiting for somebody else's permission\\nto live the rest of your life\\nfaced with these waiting lists a lot of\\ntrans people do one of three things\\noption one is Private health care\\nobviously that's very expensive so it\\ntends to be the more privileged usually\\nwhite trans people who get to do that\\nand even if you can't afford it that's\\nmoney that you can't spend on a holiday\\nor a house or a wedding or it means you\\ngo into a lot of debt option two is\\nself-medication that means buying\\nhormones off the internet or sharing\\nthem with a friend I found a 2016\\narticle in the Lancet which records that\\n40 of adult patients who get an\\nappointment at the London Clinic are\\nalready self-medicating when they arrive\\nif that rate holds constant Across the\\nNation that would mean there are tens of\\nthousands of people doing it although\\nbecause it's underground who knows\\nanecdotally\\nevery British trans person I know except\\nfor two I think is either\\nself-medicating or has at some point if\\nyou're a trans woman like me then\\nself-medicating in England is legal you\\nneed a testosterone blocker and estrogen\\nand you can order both of

people do\\nprobably because they find that option\\nmore palatable\\nthan option three\\noption three is that you die\\nwhen people do die on the waiting lists\\nevery year at trans Pride there are more\\nnames read out of the people who aren't\\nhere anymore there was a recent death in\\nthe community of a woman who'd waited\\nmore than a thousand days on the waiting\\nlist\\nI've had parents of trans children\\nemail me about the kids that they've\\nlost\\nI'm gonna be honest with you writing\\nthis episode of philosophy tube has been\\na struggle because the show is about\\nbeing compassionate and seeing all sides\\nbut\\nas a human being\\nI have a strong preference for my own\\nSurvival\\nand a strong emotional reaction when I\\nsee other people needlessly suffering\\nwhat I'm saying is this episode might\\nget a little bit more personal than\\nusual because now\\nI need to tell you about what I did next\\nhaving waited much much longer than the\\nlegal maximum waiting time I decided to\\nstart sending some emails\\nI found out which trust runs the gender\\nClinic I'd been referred to and I wrote\\nto someone on their board of directors a\\nman I'll be referring to\\nas major discovery\\nmajor Discovery is the trust's head of\\ncompliance it's his job to make sure\\nthat they're following all the rules\\nhe's not a doctor and actually that's\\nworth bearing in mind the NHS is not\\nadministered by doctors it's\\nadministered by administrators\\nI wrote to Major Discovery every week\\nfor several months and eventually\\nhe wrote back\\ndear Abigail as you've noted in your\\nemail we are unable to offer a first\\nappointment with the 18-week time frame\\nthat operates for most NHS Services\\nalthough this 18 week recommendation\\ndoes in principle apply to our service\\nwe and all the other gender Services\\nnationally are unable to meet this\\ntarget currently due to very high demand\\nhere I can bring in one of our big\\nphilosophers for today\\nSarah Ahmed and her book complaint which\\nis all about how making complaints to\\ninstitutions reveals the way they really\\nwork\\nin his letter to me major decoverly was\\nusing a very interesting technique from\\nmanagement and business philosophy a\\ntechnique called lying\\nthe 18-week time limit is not a\\nrecommendation or a Target that applies\\nin principle\\nit's actually a right I pointed this out\\npolitely of course and his next move\\nseemed a little better if you would like\\nto discuss any aspect of your complaint\\nfurther please do let me know and I will\\narrange for you to speak to a senior\\nmember of the gender identity Clinic\\nthat sounded like progress talking to\\nthe guy who runs the clinic yeah if\\nanyone can get me an appointment he\\nsurely can so we arranged a meeting he\\npicked the time and place\\nI waited for over an hour\\nand he never turned up I honestly cannot\\nstress enough to you how absolutely\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] [\\xa0__\\xa0] all these people are at\\nscheduling\\nthey miss emails they forget to press\\nsend when they write their replies\\nmultiple times we've arranged meetings\\nthey chose the time and place and then\\nthey just never turned up\\ntrying to reach them is like attempting\\nThe Impossible all these little mistakes\\nget made but they're always mistakes\\nthat benefit the institution never the\\nperson complaining and for this reason\\nSarah Ahmed coins the term strategic\\ninefficiency\\nthe harder it is to complain the fewer\\ncomplaints they have to deal with the\\nmore they can just carry on doing what\\nthey're doing she also says that making\\na complaint becomes a kind of unpaid job\\nbecause in order to complain about a\\nsystem you have to spend a lot of time\\nlearning about how it's supposed to work\\nI don't think I can adequately explain\\nto you just how maddening it is to go\\nthrough all that organizational hell and\\nthen when you finally get into the\\nmeeting they don't know the rules that\\nthey're supposed to be following\\nso often in this process I have wanted\\nto say to these people\\nwhy am I doing your job\\njust dozens and dozens and dozens of\\nemails\\nhundreds of hours spent doing this in my\\nfree time just to get an appointment\\nwith a doctor\\nand so that I can turn it into\\neducational content for all of you fine\\npeople\\npatreon Dot\\ncom slash philosophytube\\nI am no longer asking sign the [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\nexhaustion can become a management\\ntechnique so much of the work of\\ncomplaint is work we would not have to\\ndo with institutions were as committed\\nto creating open accessible and\\ninclusive environments as they claim to\\nbe eventually I managed to reschedule\\nthat meeting\\nand I came face to face with a man who\\nactually runs a gender identity Clinic\\nI'll call him\\nmajor major\\nhe's not a doctor but he sat there and\\nhe nodded and listened sympathetically\\nas I explained I'd been waiting for\\nlonger than the legal maximum waiting\\ntime and I'd like my appointment now\\nplease he told me the exact same thing\\nmajor to coverly had\\nthey aren't working within the 18-week\\ntime limit\\nand they aren't going to\\nI I don't understand exactly what it is\\nthat you think I can do you're a major\\nmajor major major\\nyou can just sign things sign what the\\nform what form after several weeks of\\nback and forth it dawned on me that\\nmajor Discovery had arranged this\\nmeeting not to actually solve the\\nproblem\\nbut to try and get rid of me Ahmed says\\ninstitutions handle complaints using\\nnon-performative speech\\nin philosophy performative speech is\\nwhen you say something and by saying it\\nyou also do it like when you say I\\npromise you're speaking but you're also\\ndoing the act of promising or if you're\\nat a straight wedding and the officiant\\nsays I Now Pronounce You man and wife\\nthey're saying it and they're doing it\\non the flip side non-performative speech\\nis when you say something and by saying\\nit you prevent it from being done like\\nwe are listening to feedback we take\\nyour concerns very seriously\\nnon-performative speech is how an\\ninstitution can appear to be doing\\nsomething about a problem whilst\\nactually very deliberately doing nothing\\nmajor major supplied a top-tier example\\nwhen he said that whilst the waiting\\ntimes are bad\\nwe are working hard\\nto improve the quality of weight\\nI said that's like telling me you're\\ngoing to keep kicking me in the face but\\nyou're working hard to put on softer\\nshoes I pointed out that by failing to\\ntreat patients within the required time\\nsome of whom died\\nthe clinic was doing a great deal of\\nharm to trans people and at this point\\nmajor major got upset\\nhe said I'm a black gay man I'm a trans\\nAlly I have trans friends I'm on your\\nside here\\nwhich was very interesting because we'd\\nbeen talking about the failures of the\\nclinic\\nbut he substituted to the clinic for\\nhimself as a person\\nhe took my complaints about the failures\\nof the system as an attack on his\\ncharacter\\nand in so doing he made the conversation\\nabout his feelings rather than the\\nfailures that he's responsible for and\\nhow he's going to fix them this is also\\na management technique that Ahmed and\\nothers have identified\\nThe Scholar Manta akapadi talks about\\nher experiences trying to criticize\\nUniversity departments for institutional\\nracism and she found that when she\\nraised this problem the white women in\\ncharge of the University departments\\noften cried because they thought they\\nwere being called racist\\ntheir hurt feelings then become the\\nproblem and the real problem the\\ninstitutional racism\\nnever got addressed open your eyes\\nClevenger it doesn't make a damn bit of\\ndifference who wins the war to someone\\nwho's dead congratulations I can't think\\nof another attitude that could be\\ndependent upon to give greater Comfort\\nto the enemy the enemy is anybody who's\\ngonna get you killed no matter which\\nside he's on having established pretty\\nthoroughly the major major was a dead\\nend I went back to Major discovery and\\nthis time he said that if I was still\\nunsatisfied with how my complaint had\\nbeen resolved\\nbecause it hadn't been resolved\\nI was free to make a complaint to the\\nParliamentary and Health Service\\nOmbudsman which I guess in this example\\nwould be like the military police\\nthey're an independent body who was\\nsupposed to investigate the NHS when\\nthings go wrong so I made a formal\\ncomplaint to them and they told me that\\nthey would assign an investigator within\\neight weeks\\n16 weeks later they did\\na man I'll be referring to as chaplain\\nChapman Chapman Chapman was honestly the\\nonly person I spoke to in this whole\\njourney who was the least bit\\nsympathetic\\nhe asked me how my experiences had made\\nme feel about major Discovery and major\\nmajor\\nand I quoted Moby Dick to him which we\\nboth found very funny Chaplin insanity\\nis contagious\\neverybody's crazy except for us you and\\nI have to be careful\\nwe may be the only same people in the\\nentire world however after several more\\nmonths of waiting for him to investigate\\nhe told me his superiors had ordered him\\nto drop\\nthe case I apologize for this negative\\noutcome\\none thing I was surprised to hear from\\nchaplain Chapman though was that there\\nwere other cases that he was also being\\nordered to drop\\nit honestly hadn't occurred to me before\\nthat anyone else might have taken it as\\nfar as I had\\nAhmed talks about how official\\ncomplaints procedures can be\\nindividualizing which kind of just means\\nlonely the NHS has no way for a group of\\npeople to complain together about the\\nsame problem you have to do it alone and\\nbear the cost on your time and your\\nemotions alone too which is another way\\nof discouraging you from trying I guess\\nif somebody really wanted to they could\\nput together a kind of collective\\ncomplaint like they could get together\\nwith some friends and go down to NHS\\nEngland's offices maybe with some signs\\nand placards and a microphone\\nso I did\\ntogether with a bunch of activists from\\na group called transgender action block\\nI attended a protest outside NHS\\nEngland's offices\\nthere were hundreds of us who'd all just\\nbeen denied Healthcare\\nsome of whom had been left in pain\\nbetween surgeries some of\\nsome of whom had lost friends and\\nrelatives but it still didn't get me an\\nappointment\\nNHS England never even publicly\\nacknowledged that protest took place\\nI cried on the phone to chaplain Chapman\\nI asked is there anyone else I can\\npossibly appeal to besides God\\nand he said I'm not aware of their being\\na higher authority\\nbut\\nhe was wrong there is a higher authority\\nthere is and after a few more months of\\nemailing I found him the man behind the\\nman\\nthe man who gives the orders\\ncolonel caccott colonel Cathcart is the\\nhead of NHS England's specialized\\ncommissioning he tells the trusts how\\nthey have to handle medical transition\\nhe can't act on his own but everyone I\\nspoke to told me he's the guy and when I\\nemailed the CEO of the NHS herself\\nshe also passed me back down to him I'm\\nColonel Cathcart and as of now I'm in\\ncharge of you sorry ass bunch of\\nhomosexuals by the way a lot of these\\npeople's emails aren't publicly listed\\nand it was kind of fun to go hunting for\\nthem I managed to get in touch with the\\nCEO of the NHS by getting her old\\nworkplace email off LinkedIn emailing\\nthat and getting an automatic out of\\noffice reply saying hey I'm leaving this\\njob now to go and run the NHS if you\\nneed me here's my new email address and\\nI was like yes I'm in I told Colonel\\nCathcart I had been waiting for much\\nmuch longer than the legal maximum\\nwaiting time and I would like to have my\\nappointment now pretty please he told me\\nto take it up with major major in major\\nto coverly and I said Colonel you're not\\ngoing to believe it but uh\\nthey've already sent me to you and then\\nhe told me that the reason for the\\ndelays was because GPS are uncooperative\\nthe very problem I'd encountered at the\\nstart he told me that everyone wants to\\nchange the system and make it faster but\\nthey can't because GPS won't let them\\nthe GPS are scared he told me and one of\\ncathcart's flunkies sent me this this\\ndocument is from 2019 it was published\\nby the Royal College of GPS it's titled\\nthe role of the GP in caring for gender\\nquestioning and transgender patients\\nthey really need a more exciting naming\\nsystem\\nin it the Royal College acknowledges\\nthat GPS get no training in trans\\nHealthcare and that trans patients\\nsometimes have bad experiences so they\\nrecommend more resources in the system\\nand more training\\nand that's basically it there's nothing\\nin here to support cathcart's claim that\\nGPS are the ones standing in the way of\\nchanging the system in fact it seems to\\nme that when you actually read this\\ndocument they acknowledge several\\nreasons why the system should change\\nit's even weirder too that he sent me\\nthis given that it makes a bunch of\\nrecommendations from 2019\\nand none of them have actually happened\\nso why send me this as if it explains or\\nsolves anything but then I remembered\\nsome more Philosophy from Sarah Ahmed\\nshe talks about how documents become\\ntools of institutional performance they\\ndon't really exist in order to be read\\nthey exist to give the institution a\\ngood image\\nan example might be anti-bullying\\npolicies your workplace probably has one\\nand our match talks about how when she\\nencountered bullying in her workplace\\nshe reported it to management and they\\nsent her a copy of the policy\\neven as they defended the bullies\\ndocuments create fantasy images of the\\norganizations they apparently describe\\nthe document says we are diverse as if\\nsaying it makes it so many practitioners\\nand academics have expressed concerns\\nthat writing documents or having good\\npolicies becomes a substitute for Action\\nas one of my interviewees puts it you\\nend up doing the document rather than\\ndoing the doing furthermore the\\norientation toward writing good\\ndocuments can block action insofar as\\nthe document then gets taken up as\\nevidence that we have done it colonel\\nKafka was just doing the same thing\\nmajor to coverly had trying to get rid\\nof me except instead of using a meeting\\nhe was using a piece of paper but\\nsince he tried to shift the blame to the\\nRoyal College of GPS\\nyou know what I did next\\nyou know I had to do it to him I emailed\\nher a college of GPS\\nand after doing that every week for\\nseveral months then let me speak to one\\nof our top guys a guy I'll call major\\nDanby\\nI actually asked major Danby upright is\\nit true what Colonel Cathcart said Is it\\ntrue that GPS are the reason behind all\\nof this and he said oh no no\\nmedical association's fault\\nso I emailed them too\\nI'm not giving up\\nthis is my white whale\\nthat's right [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\nI was assigned hater at Birth they told\\nme it was Colonel cathcart's fault\\nat this point I was feeling very calm\\nvery normal\\nJoker makeup was bursting out of my Paws\\nI was turning into a giant insect\\nfalling down an infinitely repeating\\nstaircase things of this nature\\nI couldn't understand it we have the\\nright to be seen within 18 weeks\\nI'd waited at this point over a year\\njust what the heck is going wrong with\\nthe NHS\\n[Music]\\nnow I bet that some of you are sitting\\nthere thinking\\nthat sucks but what do you expect the\\nNHS is in crisis\\nand you are absolutely right to show you\\njust how right you are I'd like to take\\na moment now to calmly\\nimpartially explore exactly why the NHS\\nis in crisis it is true that the\\nsituation is pretty dire for everyone\\nright now there are over 7 million\\npeople in England on some kind of\\nwaiting list for NHS care the majority\\nof maternity units in England no longer\\nmeet safety standards there are parts of\\nEngland where you'll wait for several\\nhours just to get an ambulance and\\npublic satisfaction with the NHS is at a\\n25 year low there are Regional\\ninequalities too the healthcare that you\\nget in Newcastle where I'm from might be\\nof a very different standard to the\\nhealthcare you get in Sunderland just\\none city over and that sucks because\\nas much as it pains me to say it\\nthe people of Sunderland\\ndo deserve to live\\nobviously on the condition that they\\nrenounce their football team things are\\ncertainly a mess but on the other hand\\nbeing impartial\\nI'm sure the health secretary has a plan\\nto fix it\\nwhoever that is this week depending on\\nwho you ask there are different\\nexplanations for all this Mass according\\nto the government things were pretty\\nokay but then covert came along and it's\\ntrue that covered did not help the\\npandemic swallowed up a lot of the nhs's\\ncapacity still is and a lot of Frontline\\nhealthcare workers burned out or had to\\nbe re-tasked or just died according to\\npeople who don't like brexit brexit\\ncaused a staff shortage and it's true\\nthat that probably didn't help either\\nbecause a lot of NHS staff were from the\\nEU emphasis on were now that we've left\\nit is easier for them to go elsewhere\\nbecause European citizens have freedom\\nof movement if you're a doctor in France\\nand you want to work abroad\\nyou could fill out a whole bunch of\\nforms and pay a bunch of money to go to\\nEngland or you could you could go to the\\nNetherlands for free where you've got\\nmore rights and the pay is better and\\nalso they have double decker trains in\\nthe Netherlands which is really cool\\nwe're having to recruit more medical\\nstaff from outside the EU now to make up\\nfor the brexit shortfall which is\\nhappening but it does take a little bit\\nof time however we should also bear in\\nmind that this snowball has been rolling\\nfor a while for the last decade and\\nchange there's been a lot of cuts to\\npublic services and when you slash\\nbudgets not as much stuff can be done\\nthings run understaffed overworked\\nunderpaid people burn out new people are\\nhard to find anecdotally almost every\\ndoctor I know is planning to move to New\\nZealand there was already a staffing\\ncrisis in the NHS before brexit or covid\\nand the capacity was already falling too\\nremember earlier I said there are seven\\nmillion people in England on some kind\\nof NHS waiting list well before the\\npandemic that number was already four\\nand a half million so\\nI think the ship had a few holes in\\nbefore we even hit the iceberg Captain\\nthe NHS has also been massively impacted\\nby cuts to local government because in\\nEngland local government handles Social\\ncare for example let's say that you're\\nan older person and you have a knee\\nreplacement in an NHS hospital after a\\nfew days you're well enough to go home\\nbut you need a social worker to go and\\nget groceries for you or to just pop in\\nand check on you every now and again\\nwhilst you continue recovering well the\\nbad news is there aren't enough social\\nworkers there aren't even enough people\\nto process your application for a social\\nworker because budget cuts\\nyou're not sick enough to stay in\\nhospital but you're not really well\\nenough to go home on your own so you\\njust kind of sit there like a lemon\\nthere are a lot of people sitting around\\nin hospital beds who don't need to be\\nthere but who can't be discharged\\nbecause they've got nowhere they can go\\nand that means that new people can't\\ncome in these cuts are also very\\ndifficult to row back on one way that a\\ntrust can make up a shortfall in its\\nbudget is by selling its assets off to\\nprivate developers and once a piece of\\nthe Health Service is owned by an\\nAmerican private Equity Firm or a\\nChinese Investment Group they ain't\\ngoing to want to give it back if a job\\nlike nursing for instance just doesn't\\npay enough for people to live on then\\nthat creates massive recruitment\\nproblems that are very difficult to get\\naround on the other hand\\nbeing impartial\\nI'm sure that after over a decade of all\\nthese cuts the British economy is in\\ngreat shape\\nwith all this ambient crisis going on\\nisn't it understandable that things are\\nbad for Trans patients I mean wouldn't\\nit be unfair to criticize the NHS even\\nungrateful wouldn't it play right into\\nthe hands of the people who want to\\nprivatize it\\nthat's definitely an argument that some\\npeople make and\\nI'm being calm and rational and\\nimpartial so I'm not gonna say no\\nbut I am\\nvery strongly going to say yes\\nand my GP didn't refuse to help me\\nbecause they didn't have the money it\\nwould have cost her nothing to actually\\ndo her job\\nthe 2013 and 2015 investigations into\\ntrans Healthcare didn't find problems of\\nbudget they found problems of bigotry\\nalso in 2015 the women under quality\\nselect committee issued a report on the\\nstate of trans Healthcare which again\\nidentified Prejudice as a major obstacle\\nand we aren't the only minority that\\ngets hit by it unfortunately remember\\nearlier I said that the majority of\\nmaternity units in England don't meet\\nsafety standards well black women are\\nfour times as likely to die in\\nchildbirth than white women\\noh and if you're trans and a person of\\ncolor that's a double whammy pretty much\\nall of these reports also say that\\ngetting trans Healthcare is even more\\ndifficult if you aren't White\\nalthough they never say it in those\\nterms they're always like this report\\nidentifies\\ninconsistencies in the treatment of\\ntransgender patients of colors needs are\\nnot always consistently being met by the\\nHealth Service and it's like guys if you\\njust call it racism think how much money\\nyou'd save on printering I'm not saying\\nthat everyone who works in the NHS is a\\nfrothing bigot I'm just saying it is a\\nfact that the NHS admits not all the\\nproblems are caused by a lack of funding\\nand with that in mind\\nI'd like to take a closer look now at\\nhow the trans Healthcare System is\\nactually designed\\nlet's say for the sake of argument that\\nyou are a transgender woman and you want\\nto get an orchidectomy that's an\\noperation to remove your testicles in\\nthe USA they say orchiectomy but here we\\nsay orchidectomy because the whole point\\nis that you keep the d a trans woman in\\nEngland who wants that operation has to\\nfirst get an appointment at the gender\\nClinic\\nthen be diagnosed with gender dysphoria\\nthen be on hormone replacement therapy\\nfor a certain amount of time and then\\nshe needs two separate psychiatric\\nassessments\\nin contrast a cisgender man that is a\\nman who is not transgender who has\\nchronic scrotal pain and wants the same\\noperation can be sent straight to a\\nsurgeon from his GP\\nit's not like it's a difficult procedure\\neither\\nit's just like getting a tonsils out\\nexcept they do it at the other end and\\nthe same is true across the board\\na cisgender woman with chronic uterine\\nbleeding who wants a hysterectomy that's\\na removal of the womb can be referred to\\na surgeon from her GP\\ntransgender man who wants the same\\noperation from the same surgeon has to\\ngo through all those extra steps a\\ncisgender woman who wants to take\\nestrogen for menopause can get it from\\nher GP in fact pretty soon she'll be\\nable to buy it from a pharmacy a trans\\nwoman who wants the same medicine has to\\ngo to the gender clinic and be diagnosed\\nwith dysphoria first\\nthis is the one that really gets me if a\\ncisgender man is worried about going\\nbald he can get testosterone blockers\\nfrom his GP\\nbut we can't this isn't how other\\ncountries do it the president of the\\nworld's Professional Association of\\ntransgender Health called the British\\nsystem outdated and inefficient in 2021\\nin Canada parts of the USA and Argentina\\nyou can start medical transition a lot\\neasier by just going to a GP\\nthat's a space GP not AGP this system is\\nvery unpopular with patients too\\nspeaking only for myself I find it a\\nlittle bit irritating that I have to go\\nto a separate clinic to get the same\\nmedicine as everyone else I mean even if\\nI could go on the same day and there was\\nno waiting list why do I have to more on\\nthat later speaking not just for myself\\nin 2018 the NHS ran a consultation in\\nwhich they asked patients what we wanted\\nto change about the system in 2015 the\\nwomen in equality select committee also\\nasked both reports clearly record\\npatients desires for an informed consent\\nsystem one in which we don't need to get\\na doctor's permission to transition but\\nwe can just get our health care the same\\nway everyone else does in 2013 that GP\\nreport that I mentioned earlier also\\nrecommended an informed consent system\\nsurprise surprise systems like that are\\nassociated with higher patient\\nsatisfaction and it would save the NHS a\\nhuge amount of money running these\\nseparate clinics has massive costs for\\nStaffing and training and computers if\\nthey just gave us Healthcare the same\\nway CIS people get the way other\\ncountries do the way we've been asking\\nfor years it would genuinely save the\\nNHS a lot of cash despite this Defenders\\nof the British system say that it makes\\nsure only Specialists control who\\ntransitions this supposedly prevents\\nharm to patients in particular the harm\\nof someone transitioning and then\\nregretting it yes the system can be very\\ndifficult but it has a benevolent goal\\nand if you're very clever you'll already\\nhave spotted what's wrong with that\\nargument\\ncast your minds back to the very first\\nthing that happened to me in my quest to\\nget Healthcare my GP who had no training\\nin trans medicine refused to send me to\\nthe gender clinic and there was nothing\\nI could do it's supposed to be that only\\nSpecialists control who transitions but\\nin reality\\neveryone in this system from the\\nSpecialists to the GPS to the\\nreceptionist who answers the phone\\neveryone has the power to deny patients\\nMedical Care by simply refusing to do\\ntheir jobs\\nas sociologist Ruth Pierce points out in\\nher book understanding trans Health in\\nthis system everyone controls who\\ntransitions except the patient who's\\ndoing it\\nthe system also doesn't prevent harm as\\nwe've seen it causes a great deal of\\nharm\\ndenying patients Medical Care\\nsome of whom die as a result\\nand many others are forced to take risks\\nlike self-medication but regret is a\\nmuch more interesting consideration for\\nall sorts of reasons we don't have time\\nto get into today medical regret is\\nactually a fascinating field and one\\nthat's very difficult to do studies on\\nbecause like what are the units of\\nregret wistfulness per kilogram perhaps\\nthe data we have suggests that\\ntransition regret is actually very rare\\nI found a meta-analysis of 27 studies\\nthat looked at just under 8 000 trans\\npatients in several countries who'd had\\nsome form of surgery and which found a\\nregret rate of about one percent\\nthe other way of phrasing that would be\\nto say that gender confirming surgery\\nappears to have a satisfaction rate of\\nabout 99 according to that meta-analysis\\nwhich is remarkably High especially when\\nwe compare it to other surgeries and\\nthat's the kicker because do you know\\nwhat kind of surgery actually has quite\\nHigh regret rates\\nknee replacements\\nbut there's no need for a psych\\nevaluation before you get one of them\\nanother example nose jobs\\nno psych evaluations there surgeon just\\nsays okay tell me what you want Cyrano\\nde Bergerac or Lord Voldemort\\nif you're not gonna block CIS people\\ngetting Medical Care on the grounds that\\nthey might regret it\\nit's pretty paternalistic to only do it\\nfor us\\nthe argument from regret is supposed to\\njustify having this two-track system but\\nactually it assumes the very thing it's\\nsupposed to be arguing for namely that\\ntransmedicine and CIS medicine should be\\nseparate that trans regret and CIS\\nregret should never be compared\\ndesigning the system to avoid\\nhypothetical regret also assumes that\\nthere is a conflict of interest between\\ntrans people and people who regret\\ntransitioning but actually we could be\\non the same side\\nthere are a small number of people who\\ndo de-transition I found one study from\\nBritain that looked at over 3 000 trans\\npatients and found that 13 of them about\\n0.4 percent de-transitioned and\\ninterestingly most of those\\nde-transitioned temporarily and\\nre-transitioned later the study could\\nonly find three people who stopped\\npermanently although there might be more\\nbecause if you just stop taking your\\nhormones and going to the clinic then\\nyou're not going to turn up in the data\\nbut regardless even if it is only three\\npeople\\nthey still matter\\nthey still need health care too\\nand having to go around the houses to\\ntry and get it the same way we do is\\npresumably just as much of a pain in\\ntheir ass and this is the really\\nmaddening thing the real jokification\\njuice if the NHS just gave us an\\ninformed consent Healthcare System it\\nwould save them a whole lot of money and\\ntime and produce better Healthcare\\noutcomes for everyone who uses it\\nthat's why I personally cannot accept\\nthe argument that we should just suck it\\nup because the NHS is in crisis and if\\nyou take nothing else from today's video\\nthen please let it be this\\nthe deadly waiting times for Trans\\nHealthcare in Britain are not caused by\\nunderfunding excessive demand or a lack\\nof staff and when the NHS says that I'm\\nreally sorry but they're just not\\ntelling the truth\\nthese problems are caused by bad system\\ndesign and once I understood that\\nI was ready for what came next\\nbecause Colonel Cathcart sat me down and\\nhe said okay\\nyou clearly understand the system and\\nall of its problems so\\nwhat do you\\npropose\\n[Music]\\nthis is not the first time that the NHS\\nhas dropped the ball and looking at\\nprevious mistakes might help us to learn\\nsomething\\nso with that in mind I'd like to talk\\nfor a moment about the natural births\\nScandal Sometimes the best way to\\ndeliver a baby is by doing what's called\\na cesarean section so if the baby's the\\nwrong way around or if there's any\\nnumber of problems rather than push it\\nout through the vagina the doctor can\\ncut open the womb and lift it out and\\nwhen it's done properly the procedure is\\nvery safe and normal I actually know\\npeople who've been born by C-section and\\nit's completely fine\\nbut starting in the 1980s the NHS the\\nRoyal College of midwives and the Royal\\nCollege of Obstetricians and\\ngynecologists somehow got it in their\\nheads that C-sections are very bad and\\nyou should only ever do natural birth\\nand there was never really any evidence\\nfor this in fact this story is a great\\nexample of the ways in which the top\\nlevels of medical organizations can\\nsometimes latch on to things that aren't\\nreally supported by the medical evidence\\nmore on that later\\nunfortunately\\nit had disastrous consequences the\\nShrewsbury and Telford trust tried to\\nreduce their number of C-sections to\\nzero with the result that between 2000\\nand 2019 hundreds of babies were left\\nstillborn or with permanent brain damage\\nfractured skulls and other complications\\nfrom Forced delivery at least 12 mothers\\ndied in childbirth and had they gotten\\nC-sections they'd still be alive\\ntheir families spent years campaigning\\nto try and get this investigated there\\nwere inquiries and reviews which the\\ntrust fought every step of the way but\\neventually the truth came out the Royal\\nCollege of midwives has now officially\\napologized and accepted that its\\nposition on C-sections was not based on\\nthe medical evidence the president of\\nthe Royal College of Obstetricians has\\nalso formally apologized and the\\nShrewsbury and Telford trust has paid\\nout more than 58 million pounds in\\nDamages and Counting\\nthe reason I tell this story is because\\nit shows that no matter how bad things\\nget it is possible to address it we\\ncan't bring back the people who died or\\nundo the suffering\\nbut the NHS can and does face up to its\\nmistakes\\nand if they can do it for the natural\\nbirth scandal then they can do it for us\\none thing that would be good then would\\nbe if there was some kind of inquiry or\\ntruth commission set up to look at the\\nissues we've raised today somewhere\\nwhere the people who were denied health\\ncare and the families of the ones who\\ndied had a chance to tell their story\\nsomething a bit more formal than lady\\nand silly costumes makes a video essay\\nit would be nice too if that inquiry\\nfeatured a majority of trans people on\\nits governing body there have been NHS\\nreports into this sort of thing before\\nbut they tend to be oh CIS people have\\ninvestigated themselves and concluded\\nthey did nothing wrong\\nthe report from that inquiry would then\\ngive us a nice place to start talking\\nabout material changes like apologies\\nresignations changing the system\\nmemorials damages public executions that\\nsort of thing it would be cool if gp's\\ngot some training in transmedicine the\\nrcgp recommended that years ago so it'd\\nbe great if they actually got around to\\nit there's lots of people who benefit\\nfrom that sort of thing actually people\\nwho have endometriosis all who go\\nthrough menopause have a really hard\\ntime getting GPS to listen to them so if\\ndoctors actually knew a little bit more\\nabout the communities are meant to be\\nhelping as well as you know tackling\\nPrejudice in the workforce that sort of\\nthing would be really helpful too\\ndecriminalizing testosterone might also\\nhelp a lot of people do have to resort\\nto self-medication when the NHS fails\\nthem so a harm reduction approach would\\nprobably do a lot of good there that's\\nnot something the NHS could do on their\\nown it would require political pressure\\nto bring about my dad suggested that I\\nwrite to my mp about all this so at time\\nof recording I have sent my mp 19 emails\\n12 phone calls and one handwritten\\nletter all of which she has completely\\nignored\\nI got a campaign leaflet through my\\nletterbox the other day being like hey\\nremember to vote for me at the next\\nelection and I was like\\nbabes you should book yourself an\\norchidectomy because you've got some\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] balls external pressure could\\nalso be brought through the courts\\nwhenever I talk about this subject\\nAmericans always tell me you should\\nlaunch a class action lawsuit which\\nsounds great but sadly it doesn't really\\nexist in England the NHS is currently\\nbeing sued by four trans people though\\nthat's why Chaplin Chapman was ordered\\nto drop my case his superiors say he\\ncan't do anything that might affect the\\noutcome at time of recording the case is\\nscheduled to be heard any day now and it\\ncould have major ramifications at the\\nend of the day though the big solution\\nis the one that's been staring the NHS\\nin the face for years the one we've been\\nasking for for years the one that other\\ncountries already do\\nan informed consent system\\nI actually said this to Colonel Cathcart\\ndirectly I said hey why not just close\\nthe gender clinics get rid of the\\nwaiting list entirely let us get our\\nhealth care the same way everyone else\\ndoes I mean we don't we don't need a\\ndoctor's permission to change our bodies\\nright that's that's bodily autonomy 101\\nso\\nI mean everyone agrees the system is bad\\nso you're going to change the system\\naren't you\\nand Colonel Cathcart said yes I agree\\nthings do need to change that's why I\\nhave a plan\\na plan to\\nchange\\nthe system\\nin 2020 NHS England commissioned a new\\npilot scheme called transplus here in\\nLondon it's a sexual health clinic and a\\ngender identity Clinic rolled into one\\nand this is Colonel cathcart's baby he\\ntold me so himself he wants this to be\\nthe future of trans Healthcare in\\nEngland there are more clinics like it\\non the way\\npatients and activists have been\\ncampaigning for years to get something\\ndone and\\nit's possible that this might represent\\na slight Improvement at some point in\\nthe future but when cathcot told me this\\nI wept because this plan doesn't change\\nthe system at all\\nwe still have to get permission from a\\ndoctor to get the same Healthcare that\\neveryone else can GPS still have way too\\nmuch power it's still out of step with\\nwhat other countries are doing it's\\nstill a massive unnecessary expensive\\nlayer to the system patients still have\\nno control over what happens to us and\\nthis is the bit that really gets me\\nhe wants us to just forget about all the\\nhorrible things that have happened Sarah\\nAhmed talks about how institutions have\\ntheir own relationships to time what\\nphilosophers call temporality\\nwhen you make a complaint you look back\\nat the harm that was done\\nbut in all my conversations with NHS\\nsenior officers they only want to look\\nforwards\\nthey don't want to look back\\nare the warnings they were given\\nare the promises they made\\nbut the harm that was done\\nespecially\\nthey don't want to look back at the\\npeople who died as a result of their\\ndecisions\\nor the people who were permanently\\nnegatively impacted\\nit's nice\\nthat they want to open more clinics at\\nsome point\\nbut what about the people who need\\nhealth care now what about the people\\nwho are dead\\neven if we only look at the ones who\\nsurvived tens of thousands of people\\nwere kept waiting and suffering\\nneedlessly for years they knew about it\\nand did nothing\\nthey're still suffering this is still\\nhappening people's lives are being\\ndestroyed by this system\\nand they [\\xa0__\\xa0] matter\\nthere's nothing in cathcot's plan about\\nactually fixing any of it\\nnot even an apology Ahmed says the\\nburden of forgiveness often falls on the\\nperson making the complaint\\nwe're expected to look forward like the\\ninstitution does and accept that we'll\\nnever get Justice\\nI actually asked Colonel Cathcart Point\\nBlank who's looking into these cases\\nwhen are you awarding damages\\nwhen's the public apology coming\\nwho is going to resign over these\\nfailures colonel\\nand he hasn't said anything\\ntime of recording and if we actually do\\nlook back we'll find that this plan is\\nnot what patients wanted remember we\\nsaid we wanted an informed consent\\nsystem several times they've been\\npublishing reports and investigations\\nand consultations into it for almost a\\ndecade multiple times we told them what\\nwe wanted and this is not that\\nhowever this plan shakes out it\\nrepresents NHS England and Colonel\\nCathcart in particular I'm afraid\\ncontinuing to override the expressed\\nwishes of the people they are meant to\\nbe helping when kafkart told me his plan\\nI went back to Major Danby a second time\\nand I said major\\nbased on everything I've seen it seems\\nto me that decisions about the\\nHealthcare of patients are being made\\nnot based on the medical evidence but\\nbased on\\ninterdepartmental politics and\\ninstitutional inertia and he said\\nyes you're absolutely correct\\nso I mean at least someone finally\\nadmitted it\\nas I said this has been a very difficult\\nepisode for me because\\nphilosophytube is about compassion and\\nreason\\nbut it's hard to maintain those things\\nin the face of a brutal and irrational\\nsystem\\nin truth I I hate what this experience\\nhas done to me it has\\nwasted my goodness and it has\\nmade me angry and bitter\\nand I don't like being that way\\nthe angry easy explanation is that the\\nsystem is bad because the people in\\ncharge are bad and that it won't change\\nbecause of them\\nand I don't want to think that way about\\nmy fellow human beings\\nI I don't think my old philosophy\\nteacher Mr Baker would want me to think\\nthat way either\\nI know that people try their best\\nand so there must be another explanation\\nwhy are institutions so inflexible why\\nare they so difficult to change is it\\nbecause ultimately people are nasty and\\nselfish\\nor is there\\na deeper reason and that's actually why\\nthis topic is so fascinating to study\\nbecause this sort of thing's happening\\nall over\\nwe've known that climate change is a\\nproblem for ages we know what we have to\\ndo to stop it but we keep doing things\\nthat we know won't work\\nwe know about the threats from rising\\ninequality and increasing extremism\\nwe talk and we talk and we talk and we\\ndon't do anything\\nwhy not\\nwell after a lot of research\\nI think I've found an answer\\nStafford beer was a management\\ncyberneticist which is a very cool job\\ntitle\\nand probably explained by the fact that\\nhe invented it basically he thought a\\nlot about computers and he tried to\\napply what he knew to institutions the\\njob of any institution he says is to\\ntake inputs and give consistent outputs\\nso for example imagine you've got a very\\nsimple system with one employee and\\ntheir job is to push one button whenever\\na customer asks them to in this case the\\ninput is the customer asking and the\\noutput is the button push the system has\\ntwo states that it can be in either he\\npresses the button or he doesn't so we\\nsay that it has a variety of two if you\\nhave 10 employees and they each have one\\nbutton now the system has a variety of\\n1024 that's the number of possible\\ncombinations of button pressed or not if\\nyou have a hundred employees now the\\nsystem has a variety of two to the 100\\nand if you have a system as big as the\\nNHS with employees who have jobs way\\nmore complicated than pushing one button\\nand inputs a lot more varied than please\\npush the button\\nyou can see how things get pretty\\ncomplicated pretty fast faced with all\\nthis variety How can any institution\\npossibly deliver consistent outputs in\\nan Ideal World an institution would have\\nenough variety to cope with any possible\\ninput so for example in the ultimate\\nclothing store there is one shop\\nassistant for every customer and there\\nare infinite different sizes of every\\nsingle possible item of clothing you\\ncould ever want\\nand I still can't find a crop top I\\nenjoy wearing\\nobviously that's not practically\\npossible though especially when the\\ninstitution is running on a limited\\nbudget so beer says every institution\\nhas systems in place to keep variety\\ndown we've already seen several during\\nmy Voyage Through the NHS\\nGPS with very narrow mindsets complaints\\nprocedures that are restrictive and\\nindividualizing documents that exist to\\nbe read but never followed\\nnon-performative statements that are\\nused to brush people off these are all\\nways that the NHS tries to keep variety\\ndown and keep on ticking to produce\\nconsistent outputs even when that means\\nconsistently bad ones the drive to\\nreduce variety beer says is like gravity\\nor entropy he actually calls it a\\nnatural law and says that institutions\\ndo this even when the people working in\\nthem don't want them to and even if it\\nmakes things less efficient and more\\nexpensive\\nthis is why big institutions are so\\ninflexible and why change happens so\\nslowly inch\\nby Angry Inch beer was especially\\ninterested in when this drive causes an\\ninstitution to collapse he says we\\nshouldn't really think of them like this\\nas a fixed hierarchy that's really only\\nuseful if you're trying to find someone\\nto blame\\ninstead he says try thinking of an\\ninstitution like a wave on a beach\\na wave is a system\\nwater molecules move in a circle and as\\nthey get closer to the shore the ones on\\nthe bottom are slowed down by friction\\nwith the seabed and so the circle\\nbecomes\\nelliptical\\nuntil\\nit becomes so elliptical\\nthat the water molecules on the top\\ncollapse\\nand the wave breaks\\nthis happens because the system of the\\nwave is internally unstable and there's\\nnothing anyone can do about it it's just\\nphysics\\nso too Bia says institutions have the\\ndrive to reduce variety and if that\\ndrive contradicts what people actually\\nneed from it then eventually\\nit will fail bearing all that in mind\\nin my opinion this system is failing and\\nwill continue to fail despite cathcart's\\nplan because the drive to reduce variety\\ncontradicts what patients actually need\\nif we had an informed consent system\\nwhich would be like allowing patients to\\npush the buttons ourselves that would be\\nbetter but it would massively increase\\nthe system's variety it would require it\\nto give a new kind of output\\nwhich it instinctively resists and\\nthere's one big example of this that I'd\\nlike to look at in the final section of\\ntoday's video that I think explains a\\nlot of the problems that we see here\\nthis is the spicy bit this is the bit\\nwhere probably a few people are going to\\nget a little bit upset at me but\\nI would like to talk now about the\\nconcept\\nof gender\\ndysphoria\\n[Music]\\nhere's the real [\\xa0__\\xa0] we are firmly in\\nthe territory of my opinion here not\\neveryone agrees with what I'm about to\\nargue if I'd stayed in Academia this is\\nprobably what I'd have written my PhD on\\nas we've seen by now medical transition\\nin England and let's not forget a lot of\\nlegal transition as well hinges on first\\nbeing diagnosed with gender dysphoria\\nwhich is supposedly the feeling of\\ndiscomfort that arises when there is a\\ndisconnect between the sex you were\\nassigned at Birth and the gender you are\\nand I think that this concept\\nas it is used in the NHS system\\nis a complete Croc of [\\xa0__\\xa0] the\\nphilosopher Gilbert Ryle tells a story\\nabout a guy who goes to Oxford and asks\\nto see the university and they show him\\nthe colleges and the libraries and the\\nquads and at the end of the day he says\\nyes but where's the University you\\nhaven't shown me that and he's made a\\nmistake what philosophers call a\\ncategory error he thinks the university\\nis its own building but it's not it's\\njust the sum of all those ordinary\\nbuildings A lot of people talk about\\ndysphoria as if it was its own extra\\nfeeling and I think that that too is a\\ncategory error\\nI don't think it is an extra feeling I\\nthink it's just the sum of\\nand CIS people also feel all those\\nfeelings maybe not about the same things\\nor to the same intensity but they do\\nfeel them if a cisgender woman goes\\nthrough menopause and thinks oh my my\\nbody feels bloated it doesn't feel like\\nmy own I'm anxious and depressed\\nis that not gender dysphoria\\nif a CIS man is skinny and can't grow a\\nbeard and looks at his peers and thinks\\noh I I should be manlier\\nis that not gender dysphoria\\nif a sister and the woman has hair on\\nher face and thinks oh I've got a\\nmustache I look like a man I want to get\\nlaser hair removal to get rid of it is\\nthat not dysphoria\\nI think the only plausible answer here\\nis yes but when CIS people feel those\\nfeelings it doesn't have its own\\nclinical label and\\nthey don't have to be diagnosed with it\\nto get treatment\\nremember if a CIS woman goes through\\nmenopause she can get estrogen from her\\nGP if a trans woman wants it we have to\\ngo to the gender clinic and be diagnosed\\nwith gender dysphoria when we feel those\\nfeelings it's treated differently and\\nyou might be saying well when CIS people\\nfeel those things that's body dysmorphia\\nnot gender dysphoria it is a different\\nthing but that's what I'm asking why is\\nit different\\nto which the only answer is well\\nbecause you're trans\\nand that's exactly my point\\nfunctionally in the English clinical\\nsystem gender dysphoria just means the\\nthing that trans people have\\nand in that case you might as well just\\ncall it mad disease and it's not just\\nthe concept itself that raises my\\neyebrows the history of it is also\\nquestionable\\nbeing trans used to be considered a\\nmental illness transsexuality as it was\\nthen called was added to the diagnostic\\nstatistical Manual of mental disorders\\nin 1980 and there was immediately a\\ncampaign to remove it so in 2013 the\\nAmerican Psychiatric association got\\ntogether and said we gotta update this\\nand they assembled a committee there\\nwere 12 doctors on that committee as far\\nas I can find all of them were CIS side\\nnote one of them was Ray Blanchard a\\nname that all the trans people in the\\naudience will know because banchard has\\nsince been disgraced and his\\num theories about us have been thrown\\nout by the medical community and\\nthoroughly debunked including by other\\nYouTubers more talented than me this was\\nthe committee that pretty much invented\\nthe modern concept of gender dysphoria\\nas it is used today this team of 12\\nlooked at the history of diagnosing\\ntrans people looked for patterns in the\\nmedical literature and came up with\\ntheir new diagnosis dysphoria\\nunfortunately there was a major problem\\nwith the data that they relied on a\\nproblem which also makes the diagnosis\\nextremely difficult to actually use how\\ndo you diagnose someone with gender\\ndysphoria\\nor transsexuality or mad disease or\\nwhatever we're calling it this decade\\nwhen you get to the gender Clinic what\\ndoes the specialist actually do\\nwell they ask you questions of course\\nthis person who has the power to decide\\nwhat the rest of your life will look\\nlike asks you questions to make sure\\nthat your answers fit the ones they have\\nin their textbook\\nand can you guess what the problem is we\\nlie\\nor not even necessarily lie but just we\\ntell them what they want to hear\\nthere's a documented history of trans\\npeople doing this since at least the\\n1950s and we're still doing it a 2015\\nstudy found that about 30 percent of\\ntrans-respondents admitted to lying or\\nwithholding information during their NHS\\ngender assessments because of course we\\ndo\\nif you wait several years for that\\nappointment and you finally get in the\\nroom with a person who has your life in\\ntheir hands a person who is almost\\ncertainly CIS and they ask you so when\\ndid you know\\nof course you're going to say oh ever\\nsince I was a child yeah I wore my\\nmother's dress I called myself Wendy\\nlike all I want is to be a 1950s\\nhousewife and marry a man of course\\nyou're gonna say that\\nI'm not saying you should lie to your\\ndoctor I'm saying it's a fact that it\\nhappens\\nit's always been a problem and it's\\nalways going to be a problem as long as\\nwe have to pass a behavioral assessment\\nto get health care\\nto put it in cybernetic terms we\\nourselves reduce the variety of inputs\\nto the system because unless we give the\\nright inputs\\nwe don't get to live it's a running joke\\nin the British trans community that the\\nassessments for gender dysphoria are\\nridiculous but to be honest the\\nquestions they ask can also be very\\nhumiliating\\nhow do you masturbate\\nhow often\\nwhat do you think about when you\\nmasturbate what do you wear when you\\nmasturbate\\nwho do you have sex with how often what\\npositions\\ntell me about your childhood were you\\nabused as a child what toys did you play\\nwith were you abused as a child which\\nother children did you choose to play\\nwith were you abused as a child\\nwhat was your first sexual experience\\nwhen did you start having sex\\ntell me again specifically in detail how\\ndo you masturbate\\non and on\\nand on\\nit's humiliating enough as an adult to\\nbe interrogated like that by a stranger\\nI can't imagine what it's like if you're\\na trans child\\nand it's not like you can say hang on a\\nminute where's your evidence that any of\\nthis is medically relevant because they\\nhave the power to deny you health care\\nand if you're the committee in 2013\\ngoing through the reports from those\\nassessments trying to find the patterns\\nyou've got no way of knowing how\\naccurate that data is which raises\\nserious questions about the reliability\\nof their conclusions\\nthere's no way of knowing whether gender\\ndysphoria is a real diagnostic pattern\\nor just\\na collective invention I remind you that\\ngetting trans Healthcare in England and\\na lot of legal transition to requires\\nyou to go through that interrogation\\nfirst that's the real reason the waiting\\nlist is so long there are very few\\nSpecialists who conduct these\\nassessments apparently it's hard to\\nrecruit people to do the job of asking\\nstrangers how they jack off but even if\\nthere were a million of them even if the\\nasking strangers have a jack off sector\\nbecame the biggest employer in the\\ncountry I just don't think it's a\\nvaluable clinical diagnosis I don't\\nthink it even makes sense and it's also\\na little bit insulting that I have to do\\nthat but a CIS person doesn't\\nI'm like The Emperor's New Clothes with\\nthis man gender dysphoria\\nthere's nothing there now we're bullied\\nand insulted and harassed and shoved\\naround all day long by insane people and\\nwe do our duty mission after mission 35\\n40 then we're told it's not good enough\\nwith all that said why not just ditch\\nthe concept of dysphoria if it's\\ngrounded in philosophical error based on\\nunreliable data incentivizes patients to\\nlie creates a deadly bottleneck in the\\nsystem and adds this whole extra\\nexpensive layer we don't need why not\\njust get rid of it\\nwe could still use the word if somebody\\nsays how are you Abby and what I want to\\nsay is\\nI feel bad about my body and the way\\nthat it is perceived by myself and\\nothers in a way that relates to my\\ngender because there is a gap between\\nwhat I want and what I have then it's\\nprobably just faster to say dysphoria or\\nhonestly most of the time it's faceted\\njust making noise like\\nthat\\nthere have been calls for years\\ninternationally to ditch the clinical\\nuse of dysphoria and just give trans\\npeople Healthcare without that extra\\nstep of a diagnosis there are some\\npractical hurdles to be sure\\nthe diagnostic requirement is very baked\\ninto the NHS and British law in 1999\\nthere was a landmark legal case a trust\\nin Lancashire announced they weren't\\ngoing to fund transition anymore on the\\ngrounds that it was merely cosmetic and\\nthey were sued by three trans patients\\nwho said actually it was necessary to\\nalleviate their gender identity disorder\\nas it was called at the time the\\npatients one which\\nmeant that we have a right to free\\ntransition but it also codified the idea\\nthat we need to be diagnosed with\\nsomething first the NHS tries to cure\\nillness rather than maximize Health\\nthose are not necessarily the same thing\\nso gender dysphoria provides an illness\\nthat they can respond to practical\\nhurdles can be overcome though\\nit would take some work to change the\\nsystem sure but it's not impossible we\\ncould have a system that gives us free\\nhealthcare and doesn't rely on\\ndiagnosing us with mad disease\\nother countries already do\\nagain and this is the question I kept\\ncoming back to with Colonel Cathcart why\\nnot change the system I have a theory\\nabout what's really going on here and to\\nexplain it I want to draw on some\\nphilosophy of disability\\nin her book the capacity contract\\nphilosopher Stacy Clifford simplicon\\nCompares two different ways of thinking\\nabout what it means to have a disability\\none is the so-called medical model you\\nhave a disability if you have a medical\\nproblem and the other is the social\\nmodel\\nyou have a disability if for example you\\nuse a wheelchair and your building\\ndoesn't have a ramp\\nthe problem isn't your body the problem\\nis that the building wasn't designed by\\nyou simplicon says that the medical\\nmodel can be very appealing to\\nable-bodied people because it soothes\\nour anxiety\\nI don't want to think about the fact\\nthat Society is unfair or that the\\nsystems I'm part of exclude people I\\ndefinitely don't want to think about the\\nfact that I could acquire a disability\\nand then I'd be the one who was excluded\\nso the medical model allows me to\\nimagine that there is a very distinct\\nline between them and me\\na line that is located in their bodies\\nwhere the problem is\\nand that also presents an obvious\\nsolution get them out of here I think\\nthat gender dysphoria does a similar\\nthing\\nbecause here's the real secret of the\\nuniverse if you want to change sex it's\\npossible\\nfor all of human history we've had this\\ndivide between men and women\\nbut if you want to cross that divide if\\nyou want to transcend it entirely and be\\nneither\\nit's possible\\nin particular hold in one

more powerful\\nwe live in a culture that valorizes men\\ntreats them as the default\\nbut when you're a trans woman you can\\ntake all of that and just\\nand you can be happier for it in a\\nmale-dominated gender hierarchy where it\\nis assumed that men are better than\\nwomen and that masculinity is superior\\nto femininity there is no greater threat\\nthan the existence of trans women who\\ndespite being born male and inheriting\\nmale privilege choose to be female\\ninstead by embracing our own femaleness\\nand femininity we in a sense cast a\\nShadow of Doubt over the supposed\\nsupremacy of maleness and masculinity I\\nthink that some CIS people are made a\\nlittle bit anxious by that\\nI think they like to imagine that male\\nand female are naturally occurring\\nstable categories and that we are just\\nthe exceptions that prove the rule I\\nthink they like to imagine that there is\\na clear Line Between Us and Them\\nand the concept of gender
